    <!-- Rule of Thirds Card -->
    <div class="card">
        <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
        <h3>NIKE</h3>
        <a href="https://www.nike.com/">Nike.com</a>
        <p>Divide the image into thirds, both horizontally and vertically, so you have 9 equal parts. <br>The important elements of your image should be placed along these lines or at the points where they intersect.</p>
        <img src="./images/nike-example.avif" alt="Rule of Thirds">
        <p>As shown in the image, the important things on the website follow the lines created by the rule of thirds.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Visual Hierarchy Card -->
    <div class="card">
        <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
        <h3>Robert and Alan</h3>
        <a href="https://www.brokeblackcomic.com/home">Robertandalan.com</a>
        <p>Visual hierarchy is the arrangement or presentation of elements in a way that implies importance. <br>It influences the order in which the human eye perceives what it sees.</p>
        <img src="./images/visualHierarchyExample.jpg" alt="Visual Hierarchy">
        <p>This is a great example of visual hierarchy. The most important pieces of information are shown more prominently.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Contrast Card -->
    <div class="card">
        <h2>Contrast</h2>
        <h3>Mad Men</h3>
        <a href="https://10up.com/our-work/mad-men-the-fan-cut/">MadMen.com</a>
        <p>Contrast is the arrangement of opposite elements (light vs. dark colors, rough vs. smooth textures, large vs. small shapes, etc.) <br>in a piece so as to create visual interest, excitement, and drama.</p>
        <img src="./images/madmen-fancut.webp" alt="Contrast">
        <p>This website is a great example of contrast. The red and white contrast perfectly and draw great attention to the page.</p>
